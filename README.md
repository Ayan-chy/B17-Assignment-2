# Project Title:Domey User Management

## Project Description

Domey is a simulated money-transaction portal created for API testing and QA learning. The application exposes RESTful endpoints for user registration, authentication, account management, balance transfers, transaction history, and simple fraud-detection checks. This repository contains a Postman collection with positive and negative test cases, Newman scripts to run the collection from the command line, and an HTML report generator to visualize results. Domey is strictly a demo system — it does not process real payments and uses mock data and test accounts. Sensitive values such as API keys or secrets are provided via environment variables or a Postman environment and must be set before running the test suite.
